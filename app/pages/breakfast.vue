    <h1>Breakfast Runs</h1>

    <p class="text-xl">
      Breakfast runs are a good opportunity to involve younger kids, generally
      fourth grade and above, in serving the homeless poor. On most Saturdays
      and Sundays, we send one to three crews out to serve breakfast and
      distribute other essential items.
    </p>

      The key elements of a breakfast run are:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Group does only one stop, assigned by Dale earlier in the week.
          Typically breakfast runs will see 30 to 60 people in winter, 75+ in
          summer.
        </li>
        <li>
          The website will announce the time and place of breakfast runs the
          week before.
        </li>
        <li>
          The food is anything you want. Groups have carried scrambled eggs,
          ham, hash browns, pancakes and oatmeal, all pre-cooked and put in
          appropriate containers to keep warm. Some groups bring a variety of
          quiches, which are easy to prepare in advance and fine served cold.
          Other meats are popular, like sausage and bacon. Guys like pastries,
          everything from donuts to coffee cake to danish. Cold cereal is okay,
          particularly in single serve boxes, but only as an adjunct. Fruit
          salad is popular, as well as bananas and oranges. And of course coffee
          and juice, or hot chocolate in winter. Use your imagination, within
          reason. But do think through the mechanics of transportation and
          serving. Cold eggs are not popular. You can get by with cold food in
          summer, but in winter plan on having something hot and nutritious.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bring some clothing, but not the full range of what you bring on a
          Midnight Run. Since you're making only one big stop, make sure you
          have enough of whatever you bring to serve at least 50. Take a couple
          of seasonally appropriate items â€” hats, gloves and sweaters in winter;
          t-shirts in summer; socks and underwear any time. And include
          toiletries, if possible, as well as blankets in winter.
        </li>
        <li>
          You should arrive some time between 8 and 9 am. Let Dale know by the
          Tuesday before so that the arrival time can be reflected on the
          website. Set up three or more card tables to serve the food. After
          everyone has a first serving, give out the clothing. You should plan
          on staying about an hour, as some people will tend to wander in late.
        </li>
        <li>
          It is best to use your own vehicles. If Midnight Run vehicles are
          available, you can take one (gassing it of course!), but breakfast run
          use is secondary to Midnight Runs.
        </li>
      </ul>
