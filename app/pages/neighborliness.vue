    <h1>Neighborliness</h1>
    <p class="text-xl">
      Here are some guidelines to being good neighbors to city residents and
      officials. It is important to remember that if we antagonize local
      residents, police, hotel staffs or private security personnel, it will be
      our homeless friends who pay the price by getting chased away from where
      they gather and sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clean up after yourselves as you get ready to leave a stop. Carry garbage
      bags and pick up loose trash. Our friends on the street will typically
      help (especially if you have a box or bag for trash). Local residents –
      even those who are tolerant of the homeless poor – will lose patience if
      our visits result in large amounts of trash.
    </p>

    <p>
      Parking instructions in your stop list are important. Pay attention to
      them. If a specific parking place is not given, it's usually better to
      stop on an avenue rather than a street (more traffic noise, less likely to
      disturb neighbors).
    </p>

    <p>
      Avoid stopping in front of active doorman buildings. In general, stop in
      front of commercial buildings that are closed for the night rather than
      residential buildings.
    </p>

    <p>
      At commuter terminals – Penn Station, Port Authority and the Staten Island
      Ferry Terminal – don't try to distribute anything inside. Just go in, find
      our homeless friends, and tell them you're outside.
    </p>

    <p>
      Noise is inevitable. Have a good time, but remember there are people
      (housed and homeless) sleeping near virtually every stop we make. Some
      volunteers (especially teenagers exuberant over the run, the hour and the
      city) need a reminder.
    </p>

    <p>
      Be considerate of the neighbors of the Dobbs Ferry office and the South
      Presbyterian parking lot. Please limit noise on the streets, and remember
      that there are two apartments above the storefront, and houses adjacent to
      the van parking area.
