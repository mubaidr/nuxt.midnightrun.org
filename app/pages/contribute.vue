      Most of the goods distributed by Midnight Run are contributed by friends
      and member groups.
    </p>

    <div>
      Here is a list of the items we need::
      <ul>
        <li>
          Clothing. Midnight Run sees far more men than women, and thankfully we
          rarely see children. We need ten items for men for every one for
          women. So our emphasis in contributions is on casual men's clothing.
          The most critical items are coats and pants, and larger sizes are
          particularly sought after, but we welcome all contributions. See
          <ULink to="/collect-and-sort">Collect and Sort Clothing</ULink>
          and
          <ULink to="/how-to-do-run">How to do a Run</ULink>
          .
        </li>
        <li>
          Food. We need durable items that are easy to store and are used on
          most Midnight Runs, including soup mix (big canisters), cocoa mix,
          coffee, bottled water, juice boxes, individual fruit cups, and
          individually packaged snack foods. For contributions of leftover food,
          go to
          <ULink to="/food-drop-of-locations">Food Drop-off Locations.</ULink>
        </li>
        <li>
          Toiletries. We need sample or travel sizes of all basic personal care
          items. See
          <ULink to="/buying-durables">Buying Durables</ULink>
          and
          <ULink to="/how-to-do-run">How to do a Run</ULink>
          .
        </li>
        <li>
          Blankets. Midnight Run receives some bulk shipments of industrial
          strength blankets each year. But softer cotton (in summer) or wool
          blankets or quilts are very much appreciated. We can use towels and
          washcloths as well.
        </li>
      </ul>
