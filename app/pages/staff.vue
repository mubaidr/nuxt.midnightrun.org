    <h1>Our Staff</h1>
    <p class="text-xl">
      The staff of Midnight Run orchestrates the efforts of over a hundred local
      coordinators and over five thousand volunteers, and the in-kind donations
      of hundreds of organizations. Several homeless or formerly homeless men
      work part-time sorting clothes as a first step back into the job market.
    </p>
    <p>
      The board is comprised of two groups â€” half the members live or have lived
      on the streets and half are active volunteer representatives of the many
      churches, synagogues and schools that participate. The collegial nature of
      this governance partnership is an integral part of the organization.
