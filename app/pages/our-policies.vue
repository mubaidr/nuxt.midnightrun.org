    <h1>Our Policies</h1>
    <p class="text-xl">
      Midnight Run has established some policies that are not obvious to the
      uninitiated, but are critical to protecting the interests of both
      volunteers and people on the street. Here's a rundown:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Publicity:</strong>
      We do not allow reporters on runs. In general, we discourage publicity.
      The interests of people on the street are not served by exposing their
      identities or where they lay their heads at night.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Photos:</strong>
      We do not allow picture-taking on runs.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Cash:</strong>
      We never give money to anyone on a run, as it sets a bad precedent for
      other groups.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Evangelism:</strong>
      Midnight Run is comprised of volunteers from many faiths, as well as
      secular volunteers. We all share an agenda of solidarity with the
      homeless. Many volunteers base their involvement on their personal
      religious beliefs, which is fine. But promoting those religious beliefs,
      or distributing literature, is forbidden. We do not, however, put
      restrictions on private conversations, as long as they do not constitute
      proselytizing.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Neighborliness:</strong>
      In over thirty years, we have never had a volunteer injured in an
      interaction on the street. But New York City can be a dangerous place. So,
      we require that volunteers stay in pairs when they go to wake someone, and
      that they stay in sight of vehicles at all times (except when accompanied
      by an experienced leader).

      <strong>Security:</strong>

    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Health:</strong>
      If you find someone in need of medical care, call 911 and stay until help
      arrives. Please don't touch anyone who is bleeding.
